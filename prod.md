# TripVibes Production Readiness Audit

> **Analysis Date:** December 29, 2024  
> **Target:** Production-ready by end of week

---

## Executive Summary

TripVibes is a functional travel itinerary generator with a complete user flow, but lacks several critical production features.

### Current State: ✅ What Works

| Core user flow (home → vibes → itinerary → saved) | ✅ Complete |
| Vibe swiping with profile building | ✅ Complete |
| Itinerary generation with streaming | ✅ Complete |
| PDF/Calendar export | ✅ Complete |
| i18n (5 locales: en, de, el, es, nl) | ✅ Complete |
| Engine tests (16 test files) | ✅ Good coverage |
| Mobile-responsive design | ✅ DaisyUI/Tailwind |
| Itinerary editing (add/move/remove activities) | ✅ Complete |
| Authentication (Anonymous & Conversion) | ✅ Complete |

---

## Critical Gaps (Must-Have)

### 1. 🔐 Authentication (✅ Done)

**Current State:** Implemented.

- AuthProvider handles user state
- AuthModal handles Anonymous -> Real conversion
- User Sync verified

**Requirements:**

- Anonymous users created on first visit (before "save vibe" modal)
- Anonymous → real account conversion flow
- Rate limit: **1 itinerary per anonymous user**
- Credits system for authenticated users (purchase credits later)
- Add `userId` to: `itineraries`, `vibe_decks` tables

---

### 2. 🚨 Error Handling Pages (✅ Done)

**Current State:** Implemented.

- `app/[locale]/not-found.tsx` (404)
- `app/[locale]/error.tsx` (runtime errors)
- `app/global-error.tsx` (root-level failures)

---

### 3. 💾 Cache Staleness UX (✅ Done)

**Problem:** Users may receive cached itineraries without knowing.

**Fix:**

- Add "Get Fresh Results" button (Bypasses cache)
- Consider cache TTL (Next step)

---

### 4. 📜 Legal Pages (✅ Done)

- Privacy Policy (Localized)
- Terms of Service (Localized)

---

### 5. 🌐 SEO & Social (Must-Have)

| Item                              | Status      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Open Graph meta tags              | ✅ Complete |
| Dynamic OG images for itineraries | ❌ Missing  |
| Sitemap.xml                       | ✅ Done     |
| robots.txt                        | ✅ Done     |

---

### 6. ⚡ Performance

| Issue                       | Fix                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| No ISR/SSG for static pages | ✅ Enabled (Home)              |
| Images not optimized        | Use Next.js Image consistently |

---

### 7. 🛡️ Rate Limiting

- Rate limit `/api/itinerary/stream` (✅ Done)
- 1 generation per anonymous user (✅ Enforced)
- Credits system for authenticated users (✅ Integrated)

---

## Should-Have

### Monitoring & Analytics

- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Usage analytics

### Testing

- E2E tests (Playwright)
- API route tests

---

## V2 (Later)

- Weather sensitivity (swap outdoor for rain)
- One-click booking (affiliate links)
- "Alternative" suggestions ("if tired")
- Logistical conflict warnings

---
