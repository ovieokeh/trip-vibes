Feedback:
Yep — and the PDF reads exactly like “vibe-first, logistics-second.” It nails taste, but it sometimes forgets you’re a human with feet and limited daylight.

Here’s how to improve the results without killing the magic of swipe-based planning.

1. Add a “Reality Score” that vetoes bad itineraries

Right now, your generator is basically: “high vibe = include”.

You need: “high vibe, but survivable.”

Add a second score that penalizes:
• Travel zigzags (back-and-forth across the city)
• Too many ‘generic anywhere’ items (IMAX/cinema-heavy days read like you could be in Utrecht)
• Redundant categories (3 galleries in a row, 2 cinemas, 2 modern-art venues, etc.)
• Overpacked days (no buffer, no meal anchors)

Then the final score becomes something like:

FinalScore = VibeScore − LogisticsPenalty − RedundancyPenalty − GenericPenalty + IconicBoost

That “IconicBoost” is important: you should gently ensure Prague feels like Prague (Old Town dusk walk, Charles Bridge moment, etc.) unless the user explicitly says “skip tourist stuff.”

2. Make “vibe cards” produce structured preferences, not just a liked list

Aesthetic cards are great, but the model behind them needs to infer why the user liked them.

Each swipe should map to latent preference dimensions, e.g.:
• Historic ↔ Contemporary
• Quiet ↔ Lively
• Mainstream ↔ Alt
• Indoor ↔ Outdoor
• Walkable ↔ “I’ll transit anywhere for it”
• Food/beer priority (some people want 2 food anchors/day)

Then your itinerary can target a balanced vector instead of just collecting liked POIs like Pokémon.

3. Build itineraries around “anchors,” then fill with nearby “texture”

People don’t want a list. They want a day that feels coherent.

Do this:
• Pick 2 anchors/day (high-confidence, high-vibe, time-bound)
• Fill the gaps with nearby texture (cafés, viewpoints, short exhibits, cute streets)
• Add buffers (winter = slower)

This one change fixes 80% of “why does my day feel chaotic?”

4. Neighborhood clustering (stop teleporting people)

Your PDF bounces between Prague 6 → Troja → Žižkov/Karlín → Prague 6 again. That’s not exploration, that’s cardio.

Implement clustering:
• Assign each POI to a neighborhood cluster (or grid cell)
• Generate each day from one main cluster + one adjacent cluster
• Penalize inter-cluster jumps

Users will still feel “variety,” but they won’t spend their trip inside a tram.

5. Time-window + season awareness (winter rules)

In January:
• It gets dark early.
• Outdoor stuff is better earlier.
• Some places close early or have special schedules.

So the generator should:
• Schedule outdoor scenic items before ~15:30
• Prefer indoor culture + cozy venues after dark
• Respect opening hours / closed days (e.g., Josefov closed Saturdays)

This is the difference between “cute plan” and “actually usable plan.”

6. “Local-ness” control: a slider, not a guess

Some users want:
• 70% iconic / 30% local
Others want:
• 20% iconic / 80% local and weird

Add a slider:
Touristy ↔ Local/Alt

Then use it as a weight in scoring.
• High “local” boosts MeetFactory, industrial heritage, niche museums.
• High “iconic” boosts Old Town / Charles Bridge / Castle essentials.

Right now your PDF leans very local/alt, but it accidentally includes generic cinema blocks that aren’t really “local” either — they’re just… indoors.

7. Diversity constraints (so it doesn’t spam one type of fun)

Add hard caps per day:
• Max 1 cinema / day (or even per trip unless the vibe explicitly says “film nerd trip”)
• Max 2 “museum/gallery” anchors per day
• At least 1 “wanderable” block per day (neighborhood walk / park / viewpoint)
• At least 2 meal/coffee anchors per day (Prague is a sit-down city)

8. UX: show why something was scheduled (and let users swap)

When people see “why,” they forgive imperfections.
Add a tiny explanation chip:
• “Picked because: industrial heritage + alt scene, 12 min by tram from your next stop.”
• “Scheduled now because: best at sunset.”

Also add a Swap button:
• “Swap for something similar nearby”
• “Swap but keep the vibe”
• “Swap and make the day calmer”

9. Data upgrades that matter more than “more places”

Not “more POIs.” Better metadata per POI:
• Category + subcategory (museum → modern art / history / niche)
• Indoor/outdoor
• Typical duration
• Crowd level
• Price tier
• “Is this Prague-specific?” rating
• Transit time matrix caching (so you can optimize quickly)

10. Measure the right thing

Don’t measure “number of liked cards used.”
Measure:
• % of itinerary executed
• # of swaps
• time behind schedule
• user rating per day
• “felt coherent?” yes/no

If execution rate is low, your generator is writing fan fiction, not plans.

⸻

Concrete improvement based on your PDF’s failure mode

Your generator needs to learn this rule:

If two consecutive items are far apart, the second item must be either (a) a stronger anchor or (b) replaced by something nearby of similar vibe.

Right now it hops without justification.
